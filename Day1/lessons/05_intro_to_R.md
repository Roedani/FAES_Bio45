## 1. What is Linux

Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released in September, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 67% of the worldâ€™s servers run some variant of Unix or Linux. Android also uses a modified version of the Linux Kernel. There are a wide variety of Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, Arch, etc).
